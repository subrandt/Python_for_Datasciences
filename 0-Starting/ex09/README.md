# ft_package

A sample test package for learning Python package distribution.

## What is this?

This is a simple Python package created as a learning exercise. It shows how to:
- Structure a Python package
- Build distributable files (.tar.gz and .whl)
- Install a package with pip
- Import and use the package in your code

## What does it do?

The package contains one function: `count_in_list()`

This function counts how many times an item appears in a list.

## Installation

### Step 0: Install build tool

First, install the `build` tool if you don't have it:
```bash
pip install build
```

### Step 1: Build the package
```bash
python3 -m build
```

This creates two files in the `dist/` folder:
- `ft_package-0.0.1.tar.gz` (source distribution)
- `ft_package-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel distribution)

### Step 2: Install the package

Choose one of these commands (both install the same package):
```bash
# Install from tar.gz
pip3 install ./dist/ft_package-0.0.1.tar.gz

# OR install from wheel
pip3 install ./dist/ft_package-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

Both commands install the package as `ft-package` (with hyphen).

### Step 3: Verify installation
```bash
# Check if package appears in pip list
pip list | grep ft-package

# Show package details
pip show ft-package
```

**Important note:** Python automatically normalizes package names by replacing underscores with hyphens.
- Source code uses: `ft_package` (underscore)
- Pip displays: `ft-package` (hyphen)
- Both refer to the same package

## Usage
```python
from ft_package import count_in_list

# Example 1: Count how many times "toto" appears
result = count_in_list(["toto", "tata", "toto"], "toto")
print(result)  # Output: 2

# Example 2: Count an item that doesn't exist
result = count_in_list(["toto", "tata", "toto"], "tutu")
print(result)  # Output: 0
```
